EVENT DETAILS:

2020 VIRTUAL COLONIE MILE

Free to everyone! HMRRC member or non-member

To participate, run a mile between July 12th and July 31st on any "fair" course (less than 10 feet elevation drop, but if you want to go up-hill, that's fine with us). 

Submit your results [here](https://membercommunications-hmrrc.wildapricot.org/event-3906509) 

We need a brief description of your course, and a link to GPS data.  A link for GPS or strava data is preferred, but if you do not use GPS you can still participate.  We just ask some questions if you break 4 minutes. 

If you improve your mile before August 9 you can submit again.  

Watch [HMRRC Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HMRRC/).  Leaderboard will be updated every few days on HMRRC Facebook page as results are received.
